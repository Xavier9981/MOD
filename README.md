# The Ministry of Defence
This is the my initial proposed vision of the new ministerial website of defence for the goverment of Zambia. The website is operating using the new system called JAMStack which is an architecture of building static websites. 

Now all this is archived with a couple addition technologies like the static site generetor netlify and eleventy.

The starting files used by [Xavier K Muneku]in the `Ministry-of-Defence` folder are:

- HTML files like `index.html` and others contained in the `pages` folder which are to be used as base for different page layouts. These can be turned into templates that will be used.
- `css` folder contains three CSS files for styling the pages.
- `script` folder holds all the Javascript for the desired logic on this site.
- `assets` has all the documents, images and logos.
